Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

Types of Contributions
----------------------

Report Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Report bugs at https://github.com/sztal/segram/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Segram` could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official `Segram` docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/sztal/segram/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.

Development
------------

Latest details on the contribution workflow and setting up a dev environment
can be found in the `Development`_ section of the README in the `Github repo`_.


Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 and for PyPy.
   Check https://travis-ci.org/sztal/segram
   under pull requests for active pull requests or run the ``tox`` command and
   make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
