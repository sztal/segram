**Abstract**

> Most currently available fake news datasets revolve around US politics,
> entrainment news or satire. They are typically scraped from fact-checking websites,
> where the articles are labeled by human experts. In this paper, we present FA-KES,
> a fake news dataset around the Syrian war. Given the specific nature of news reporting
>  on incidents of wars and the lack of available sources from which manually-labeled
> news articles can be scraped, we believe a fake news dataset specifically constructed
> for this domain is crucial. To ensure a balanced dataset that covers the many facets of the Syrian war,
> our dataset consists of news articles from several media outlets representing mobilisation press,
> loyalist press, and diverse print media. To avoid the difficult and often-subjective task
> of manually labeling news articles as true or fake, we employ a semi-supervised fact-checking
> approach to label the news articles in our dataset. With the help of crowdsourcing,
> human contributors are prompted to extract specific and easy-to-extract information
> that helps match a given article to information representing “ground truth” obtained
> from the Syrian Violations Documentation Center. The information extracted is then
> used to cluster the articles into two separate sets using unsupervised machine learning.
> The result is a carefully annotated dataset consisting of 804 articles labeled
> as true or fake and that is ideal for training machine learning models to predict
> the credibility of news articles. Our dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2607278.
> Although our dataset is focused on the Syrian crisis, it can be used to train machine learning models
> to detect fake news in other related domains. Moreover, the framework we used to obtain the dataset
> is general enough to be used to build other fake news datasets around military conflicts,
> provided there is some corresponding ground-truth available.
