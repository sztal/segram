    "## Loading and configuring language model and pipeline components\n",
    "\n",
    "`Segram` is based on the excellent <a href=\"https://spacy.io/\">spacy</a> \n",
    "package, which is used to solve the core NLP tasks such as tokenization, \n",
    "POS and dependency tagging and entity recognition. Thus, before `segram` can be \n",
    "used it is necessary to load and initialize a `spacy` language model.\n",
    "As a matter of fact, `segram` functionalities are provided by a \n",
    "dedicated pipeline component, which is automatically registered with `spacy`\n",
    "upon the package installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, to do any work we first need to download and install appropriate\n",
    "language models. In this respect `segram` is fully dependent on `spacy`,\n",
    "so we need only to download thoroughly tested models offered by `spacy`.\n",
    "We will need three different models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Main English model based on the transformer architecture.**\n",
    "   In an environment in which `spacy` is already installed the\n",
    "   model can be obtained with the command `python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf`.\n",
    "2. **Word vector model.** The transformer model is powerful, but it does\n",
    "   not provide static word vectors, but only context-dependent vectors.\n",
    "   To use structured matching implemented in `segram` we need to have access\n",
    "   to context-free word vectors, so we obtain them from a different model.\n",
    "   This one can be downloaded with: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg`.\n",
    "3. **Coreference resolution model.** The last model will be used for implementing\n",
    "   coreference resolution. This is still experimental feature not integrated\n",
    "   into the core of `spacy`, so that is why we need to use an extra model\n",
    "   for that. It can be installed with:\n",
    "   `pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-experimental/releases/download/v0.6.1/en_coreference_web_trf-3.4.0a2-py3-none-any.whl`."
